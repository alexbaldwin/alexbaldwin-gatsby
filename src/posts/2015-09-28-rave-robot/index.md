Update: Rave Robot has merged with Jon Howard's Cochlea project.

[Rave Robot &rarr;](http://staringispolite.github.io/cochlea/)

Full-screen gif mayhem. Worked on this one day last year with CH Albach in order
to show it off for a Halloween party. Since the domain is expiring, I'd prefer
it live on in the lab. It was truly ahead of it's time, but now [Cochlea](https://staringispolite.github.io/cochlea/) and
[Giphy GJ](https://gj.giphy.com/) have surpassed it's meager feature list.

Let me know if you have any feature requests.
